The Grid Empire Web World Planner is a personal project independent from the main game **Grid Empire**!

This repository was made to make accessing the website/application easier and more transparent. Because this a personal project, updates & merging pull reuqests will come whenever I am available. Feel free to contribute to the code or add to the tile/background list (dm me in the GE discord).

Disclaimer: AI was used in the making of this application.

**UPDATE**: The pyhton application of the world planner is now discontinued. Instead, I remade the world planner in HTML/CSS/Javascript to run it as a website to make it more accessible and safe for users. I will keep the python version available for those that prefer it.
## Python Application Installation & Usage [DISCONTINUED]
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/OnyxLib/Grid-Empire-World-Planner/releases) and download the latest version of the "GE_WorldPlanner_Package.zip".
2. Unzip "GE_WorldPlanner_Package.zip".
3. Open the folder and run "GE_WorldPlanner.exe". Make sure that the tiles and backgrounds folder are in the same directory/folder for it to load into the application.
4. (optional) You can upload custom tiles and backgrounds into the program by adding it to the tiles and backgrounds folder. 
5. (optional) If you do not want to run this program in your machine, please look into sandboxes/virtual machines. I recommend this from [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/).
