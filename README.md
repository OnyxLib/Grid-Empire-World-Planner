# Grid-Empire-World-Planner

:bangbang: **[WIP]** :bangbang: 
<br/>
<br/>
This application is a personal project independent from the main game **Grid Empire**! 
<br/>
<br/>
This repository was made to make accessing the application easier and more transparent. Because this a personal project, updates & merging pull reuqests will come whenever I am available. Feel free to contribute to the code or add to the tile/background list (dm me in the GE discord).

Disclaimer: AI was used in the making of this application.

## Installation & Usage
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/OnyxLib/Grid-Empire-World-Planner/releases) and download the latest version of the "GE_WorldPlanner.exe", "tiles.zip", and "backgrounds.zip".
2. Unzip "tiles.zip" and "backgrounds.zip".
3. Make sure all three files are in the same directory/folder and run "GE_WorldPlanner.exe".
4. (optional) You can upload custom tiles and backgrounds into the program by adding it to the tiles and backgrounds folder. 

## Future Plans
