# Grid-Empire-World-Planner

:bangbang: **[WIP]** :bangbang: 
<br/>
<br/>
This application is a personal project independent from the main game **Grid Empire**! 
<br/>
<br/>
This repository was made to make accessing the application easier and more transparent. Because this a personal project, updates & merging pull reuqests will come whenever I am available. Feel free to contribute to the code or add to the tile/background list (dm me in the GE discord).
<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer: AI was used in the making of this application.

If you do not want to run this program in your machine, please look into sanboxes/virtual machines. I recommend this from [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-isolation/windows-sandbox/).
## Installation & Usage
1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/OnyxLib/Grid-Empire-World-Planner/releases) and download the latest version of the "GE_WorldPlanner_Package.zip".
2. Unzip "GE_WorldPlanner_Package.zip".
3. Open the folder and run "GE_WorldPlanner.exe". Make sure that the tiles and backgrounds folder are in the same directory/folder for it to load into the application.
4. (optional) You can upload custom tiles and backgrounds into the program by adding it to the tiles and backgrounds folder. 

## Future Plans
- [ ] Add all the tiles and backgrounds when the redesign is complete
- [ ] Implement autotiling 
- [ ] Add another layer for water logged blocks
- [ ] Add shadows
- [ ] Make a website to run this world planner
